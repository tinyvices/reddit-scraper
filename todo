1. beautifulsoup to scrape reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/automoderator-schedule
2. somehow schedule scrapes based on this
3. analyzer (optional?) builds data from the scrapes
4. frontend displays interesting stats?

let's outline an MVP
- meta stats only: scrape threads as they go, determine things like:
unique posters
karma per post
other basics
--exact py scripts to 'scrape threads as they go':
- getAutoModeratorSchedule:
-   input: subreddit name
-   output: post to API all info about automoderator threads
- findThread
-   input: time, title, submitter, subreddit


for MVP, database will house ALL RAW DATA of all threads from some date for some subreddit
then the frontend (or analyzer) can start figuring things out from there

version 2: word clouds?
